#### VaexPanel
> `This Repo contains code for Panel Apps that render a DataTable powered by Vaex`
>
> The first notebook titled VaexDash contains my first attempt at creating a panel app that leverages the power  
> of Vaex to load and filter a dataframe. Vaex works with huge tabular data, processes greater than 109 rows/
> second and computes on the fly, without wasting ram.
> You can find out more by clicking on: [Vaex info](https://vaex.readthedocs.io). 
> 
> The second notebook titled VaexPanel seeks to add Pandas-like filtering to a Panel app and make the  
> filtering process more efficient. Both use Panel to create the apps. 
> Panel is an open-source Python library that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards
